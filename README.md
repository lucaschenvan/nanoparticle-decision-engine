# Nanoparticle Design Decision Engine

🔗 **Live app:** https://nanoparticle-decision-engine-8ic2umyhyojwf4utanlmuv.streamlit.app/

An interactive Streamlit app that recommends nanoparticle drug-delivery designs
based on treatment goals and tumor conditions.

## What it does
- Takes goal-based inputs (targeting, safety, circulation)
- Considers tumor and drug constraints (pH, immune sensitivity, fragility)
- Outputs a recommended nanoparticle design with clear tradeoffs

## Tech stack
- Python
- Streamlit

## How to run locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py

### ⚠️ Key details
